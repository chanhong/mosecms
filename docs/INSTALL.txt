REQUIREMENTS
------------

MoseCMS requires a web server, PHP 4 (4.3.5 or greater) or PHP 5
(http://www.php.net/).  The Apache web server is recommended; other web server such as IIS should work too. Database is optionla!  When using MySQL, version 4.1.1 or greater is recommended to assure you can safely transfer the database.


OPTIONAL TASKS
--------------

- The docs, share and siteprivate should be moved to more secure location where they are not accessible directly from the web.


INSTALLATION
------------

1. DOWNLOAD MoseCMS 

   You can obtain the latest MoseCMS from http://ongetc.com download area that has a list of various download sites.  The files are in zip format and can be extracted using most compression tools. On a typical Unix command line, use:

     unzip mosecms.zip

   This will create a new directory mosecms/ containing all MoseCMS files and directories. Move the contents of that directory into a directory within your web server's document root or your public HTML directory:

     mv mosecms/* /var/www/html


2. CREATE THE CONFIGURATION FILE AND GRANT WRITE PERMISSIONS

   MoseCMS comes will create config.php if it is not there when you access your site for the first time with the simple setup process.

   Next, give the web server write privileges to the sitepublic/config.php file with the command (from the installation directory):

     chmod o+w sitepublic/config.php

  So that the files directory can be created automatically, give the web server write privileges to the sitepublic directory with the command (from the installation directory):

     chmod o+w sitepublic

3. CREATE THE MoseCMS DATABASE (Optional)

   To create a database using PHPMyAdmin or a web-based control panel consult the documentation or ask your webhost service provider.

   Take note of the username, password, database name and hostname as you create the database. 

4. RUN THE INSTALL SCRIPT

   To run the install script point your browser to the base URL of your website (e.g., http://www.example.com).

   You will be guided through install screens to set up the site,
   add the first user account password and provide basic web
   site settings.

   The install script will attempt to write-protect the config. file and the sitepublic directory after saving your configuration. However, you may need to manually write-protect them using the commands (from the installation directory):

     chmod a-w sitepublic/config.php
     chmod a-w sitepublic

   If you make manual changes to the file later, be sure to protect it again after making your modifications. Failure to remove write permissions to that file is a security risk. 

5. CONFIGURE MoseCMS

   When the install script succeeds, you will be directed to the "Welcome" page, and you can log in as the administrator. 

   
6. REVIEW FILE SYSTEM STORAGE SETTINGS AND FILE PERMISSIONS

   Since MoesCMS does not use database and use file system to store your pages in siteprivate you need to first secure siteprivate by moving to a more secure location and make sure to give web server write permission to it, plus can upload file too.


MULTISITE CONFIGURATION
-----------------------

A single MoseCMS installation can host several MoseCMS-powered sites, each with its own individual configuration.

First you will need to move share folder to a share location and point your config.php to that location then you just make a copy of your current installtion folder to a new site and set the config.php to point to the share folder and you have your second site.

Each site can have each own config.php add-ons, templates, etc.

Here are the steps:

	cp sitepublic sitepublic2
	cp siteprivate siteprivate2
	edit config.php to point to these two folders

That's it!
