ABOUT

  php4dbi is a database abstraction layer for PHP.  It is simple to use
  (a single file with a simple API) and lean enought to not bloat your
  PHP application.

  It provides a common API for accessing a variety of database systems.
  This allows you to develop your application without limiting it to
  working on just a single database.  You also won't need to keep looking
  at the PHP documentation pages to find the correct function name for
  a particular database since they don't use a common naming scheme.
  (For example, MySQL uses mysql_connect while SQLite uses sqlite_open.)

REQUIREMENTS

  The dbi4php file is compatible with PHP4 and PHP5.  It should also work
  with PHP3 (but has not been tested on PHP3 in a few years).

  You must have your PHP installation setup/configured properly to
  communicate with your database.  For example, if you want to use Oracle,
  you will need to have PHP compiled with Oracle support.  Otherwise,
  you will receive "undefined function" errors.

  You can use the included "listdbs.php" tools from the command line
  to see which databases are accessible from your PHP installation:

    php listdbs.php

  If your database is not listed, you may need to reinstall PHP.
